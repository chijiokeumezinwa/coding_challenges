recommendation to run this program in virtual env
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install "typer[all]"
pip3 install PyInquirer
pip3 install rich

if an error pops up that looks like this 
ImportError: cannot import name 'Mapping' from 'collections'
edit the from_dict.py 
nano venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/prompt_toolkit/styles/from_dict.py

to change collections import Mapping to collections.abv import Mapping
